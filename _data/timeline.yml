                The project began with the development of an electric go-kart. Essentially, the aim was to
                replace the kart’s original petrol engine with an electric motor. This allowed the team to
                gain a practical working knowledge of the electric powertrain before moving onto the real car!

                A bare chassis. An empty car park. A driver. These were the ingredients for TBRe16’s
                first rolling test at the University of Bath.

                After months of work and many sleepless nights, we made it to Silverstone! TBRe16 did not
                race but we collected valuable feedback that will be transferred onto TBRe17. We can’t wait
                to come back.

                TBRe’s core members returned to Bath before the beginning of the academic year to promote
                the team during Fresher’s week. We were delighted to showcase TBRe16 in front of the
                library and talk about our project!

                We were thrilled to present our plans for 2017 to a group of approximately 70 students
                from a range of disciplines: mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, IMEE (integrated
                mechanical and electrical engineering) and business. This was also an opportunity to
                inaugurate our brand new build room!
