  title: About Us
  body: >-
    Team Bath Racing Electric (TBRe) is a young, exciting and innovative student
    motorsport team based at the University of Bath. Each year, TBRe designs,
    builds and tests a single-seat, open-wheel race car to compete on an
    international stage at Silverstone at the renowned Formula Student
    competition.

    Unlike many competitors, TBRe utilises a fully electric powertrain. For us,
    this is crucial to not only allow a level of mechanical and electrical
    innovation unachievable by traditional cars but also to stay relevant in an
    industry that is shifting irreversibly toward electric vehicles.

    We are lucky to be made up of motivated and committed students from across
    our Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Departments, making our team truly
    cross-disciplinary and allowing students from any discipline to share and
    gain knowledge from the other to become a much more well-rounded engineer.

  body: >-
    Since our formation in 2014, TBRe has grown and developed at an astonishing
    rate. This summer we ranked as the top UK electric team at Formula Student.
    Now we will build on our success with a new design, optimised mechanically
    and electrically, to take to Silverstone and this year's further goal:
    Formula Student Germany.

- title: Our Sponsors

    Our project would not be possible without the kind support of our many
    sponsors. We work hard to provide a mutually beneficial relationship with
    each of our supporting organisations. This can range from simple promotion
    in our team media to close technical collaboration on some of the exciting
    and innovative aspects of our car.
